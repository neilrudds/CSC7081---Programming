# Abstraction

## Definition

- Abstraction refers to the ability to make a class abstract in OOP. An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated. All other functionality of the class still exists, and its fields, methods and constructors are all accessed in the same manner.
You just cannot create an instance of the abstract class.

- If a class is abstract and cannot be instantiated, the class does not have much use unless it is sub-classed. This is typically how abstract classes come about during the design phase. A parent class contains the common functionality of a collection of child classes, but the parent class itself is too abstract to be used on its own.
